A JavaScript app that displays the local weather based on data retrieved from the Darksky API. In order for it to work, GPS must be enabled in the browser.
The image used for the weather is a Skycon, an image which is procedurally generated by JavaScript using the HTML5 canvas tag.
Additionally, by clicking the temperature, you can switch between Fahrenheit and Celsius degrees.
